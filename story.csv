alive,3,2,Captain your about to die. Press a button. (1-> Red 2-> Blue)
dead,0,0,The cabin glass in front of you begins to radiate a spiderweb of cracks. For an instant you see a vapor coming through the glass. The glass breaks and you are sucked out into space. Game over.
alive,4,5,The planet outside your cabin window spins rapidly as your ship barrel rolls through space. A loud creaking noise emanates from the back of the ship as it slowly begins to course correct and stop rotating. What's next? (1-> Head to an escape pod 2->Stay aboard and finish the mission)
alive,5,7,You unbuckle from your seat and begin to move to the back of the ship. There is one escape pod left. Would you like to continue your escape or stay and finish the mission? (1->Stay 2->Escape)
alive,7,6,You push off from the bulkhead and drift towards the engine room. Once in the engine room you see the the dilithium crystal is dislodged. It looks like if you kick it the crystal will fall back into place. (1-> Kick the crystal 2-> Wait make sure it's safe first)
alive,8,9,You remember that if the crystal cracks it will overheat and melt. You slowly push off from the crystal housing. You spin slowly towards the control panel which is flashing. It says the crystal is unstable and should be ejected. (1-> Eject the Crystal 2-> Leave it alone)
dead,0,0,As your foot makes contact with the crystal it dislodges an falls into place. Immediately the crystal begins to glow. It's looking pretty hot. It doesn't seem to be slowing down. The crystal cracks down the middle spilling radiation in the room. The crystal container begins to melt. A drop of molten crystal hits the floor melting through the hull. Immediately the hull rips apart and you are sucked out into space.
alive,10,11,You press the eject button. The drop chamber beneath the crystal opens and the crystal slides into the exit chamber. It hits the exit door and begins to glow. It's overheating. The drop chamber inner seal closes and the outer door opens dropping the rapidly overheating crystal into space. You watch it float beneath your ship growing brighter. The crystal cracks and explodes. A shockwave emanates from the blast. (1-> Go to the cabin and attempt to steer the ship 2->  Grab the nearest handhold and attempt to stay alive)
dead,0,0,You check the panel and it seems that the crystal will be ok. A warning light on the panel begins blinking rapidly. It's the radiation sensor. You turn around and see the flash of the crystal as it releases a burst of radiation. Immediately your skin begins to burn within your suit. You grasp at your suit as it begins to melt around you. And then silence as the suit pressure drops exposing and you gasp for air.
alive,12,13,As you hurtle through the ship grabbing hand holds and pulling yourself towards the cabin the ship around you groans and creaks from the approaching shock. As you slide into the captain's seat the back end of the ship pitches upwards tilting the nose down. Outside the cabin you see earth. (1-> Try to course correct and ride the shockwave away from earth 2-> Wait to see what direction the ship moves)
dead,0,0,The ship begins to creak and groan. You grab a handhold and hold on as tightly as you can. After 30 seconds of caucaphony a ripping sound can be heard for a moment. Then complete silence as you watch the ship around you break apart. You're left to drift as your oxygen runs out.
dead,0,0,As you pull up on the stick to course correct the stick loses control and quits responding with a jolt. Outside your window you see the tail of the ship begin to drift. The course correction has sheared off the tail of your ship. You slowly die; unable to maneuver or do anything but wait.
dead,0,0,As the ship tilts down you see that you're headed into the atmosphere. Within minutes the view from inside the cabin is nothing but flames ripping past the windows. You hold tightly onto the stick hoping you'll stay alive. Within a minute the flames dissipate and there is nothing but ocean below. You pull hard on the stick and feel the ship begin to pitch up. Without much time the ship hits the water belly first. When you come to the ship is rocking lightly on the waves and there is a rescue craft coming towards you hovering above the water. You have survived.
